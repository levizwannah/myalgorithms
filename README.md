# my algorithms
When I am doing projects, I am faced with problems that require me to write some algorithms to solve them. In this repository are these algorithms, please help make them optimal or leave a thank you if the are helpful to you.

# INSERT INTO BINARY TREE ALG1
This algorithm inserts a sorted list of elements into a binary tree in N steps where N is the size of the array to be inserted. The elements are inserted to produce a balanced binary tree hence giving a total insertion cost of nlogn instead of n2. Additionally, it maintains a space complexity of O(n).
The array dealt with should be a integer index based array, not an associative one.
The associative version will be released soon. If you need it, you can make a request using the issure tab.

# ->WHY IS THIS ALGORITHM USEFUL (ALG1)<-
Assuming you get the elements from, say a range function, or a Database with order by (ASC or DESC) and you want to store the results in a binary tree for quick modification. This algorithm helps you achieve that.
